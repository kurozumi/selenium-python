"These days most of the web apps are using AJAX techniques.  When a page "
"is loaded to browser, the elements within that page may load at different"
" time intervals.  This makes locating elements difficult, if the element "
"is not present in the DOM, it will raise `ElementNotVisibleException` "
"exception.  Using waits, we can solve this issue.  Waiting provides some "
"time interval between actions performed - mostly locating element or any "
"other operation with the element."

"Selenium Webdriver provides two types of waits - implicit & explicit. An "
"explicit wait makes WebDriver to wait for a certain condition to occur "
"before proceeding further with executions.  An implicit wait makes "
"WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to "
"locate an element."

"An explicit wait is code you define to wait for a certain condition to "
"occur before proceeding further in the code.  The worst case of this is "
"time.sleep(), which sets the condition to an exact time period to wait.  "
"There are some convenience methods provided that help you write code that"
" will wait only as long as required.  WebDriverWait in combination with "
"ExpectedCondition is one way this can be accomplished."

"This waits up to 10 seconds before throwing a TimeoutException or if it "
"finds the element will return it in 0 - 10 seconds.  WebDriverWait by "
"default calls the ExpectedCondition every 500 milliseconds until it "
"returns successfully.  A successful return is for ExpectedCondition type "
"is Boolean return true or not null return value for all other "
"ExpectedCondition types."
