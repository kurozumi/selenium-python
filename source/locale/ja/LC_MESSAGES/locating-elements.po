msgid "Locating by XPath"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/locating-elements.rst:115
msgid ""
"XPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document.  As "
"HTML can be an implementation of XML (XHTML), Selenium users can leverage"
" this powerful language to target elements in their web applications.  "
"XPath extends beyond (as well as supporting) the simple methods of "
"locating by id or name attributes, and opens up all sorts of new "
"possibilities such as locating the third checkbox on the page."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/locating-elements.rst:122
msgid ""
"One of the main reasons for using XPath is when you don't have a suitable"
" id or name attribute for the element you wish to locate.  You can use "
"XPath to either locate the element in absolute terms (not advised), or "
"relative to an element that does have an id or name attribute.  XPath "
"locators can also be used to specify elements via attributes other than "
"id and name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/locating-elements.rst:129
msgid ""
"Absolute XPaths contain the location of all elements from the root (html)"
" and as a result are likely to fail with only the slightest adjustment to"
" the application.  By finding a nearby element with an id or name "
"attribute (ideally a parent element) you can locate your target element "
"based on the relationship.  This is much less likely to change and can "
"make your tests more robust."
